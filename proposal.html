		<h1> Xplore (SMAD203 project)</h1>
			<h2> Map. Eat. Enjoy. </h2>
		<br> 
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
				<p> This project is intended to build an interactive mobile experience with Adobe XD. I will be redesigning and adding onto my SMAD203 User Research Assignment. I have already previously conducted user research and interviews, as well as refined the general design requirements. For this independent project, I will be redesigning the site map and constructing a prototype. The app itself, named Xplore, is designed to help connect users with local cuisine in the Downtown area. The app allows users to find nearby restaurants, look up wait times, and skim menus. Many small businesses have been negatively impacted by Covid-19, which was the primary factor in motivating me to revamp this particular project. Now more than ever, local businesses could use help getting publicity and connecting with new customers. </p>
		
				<p> The original design question for my 203 project was how might we improve the experience of students trying to discover new restaurants in downtown Harrisonburg. A goal for the independent project is to broaden the target market by expanding from just students to the whole Harrisonburg population. In Sara Wachter-Boettcher’s book Technically Wrong, she discusses how often personas can be limiting and not all encompassing. By focusing on the JMU students, I am doing a disservice to the diversity found within the Harrisonburg community. JMU is a predominantly white University, with students typically ranging from 18-23 in age. My original personas focused on students and their needs, but I believe this app will be able to better serve both it’s users and the restaurants partnering with the app if it is designed with a broader target market in mind.</p>

				<p> The app will also allow users to choose how they’d like results to be filtered. Visibility can be filtered by nearest location, wait time, cuisine type, or price point. This will limit the chances of algorithms favoring certain restaurants over others, as well as provide users with more customization. A goal of this app is to transfer some of the power from algorithms back to the end users while keeping interactions simple and concise. </p>
				
				<p> Restaurants that choose to partner with Xplore will recieve free advertising via the app, in exchance for exclusive coupons offered only to Xplore users. This will entice users to download the app and utilize it over the competition. This app is not designed to be a delivery app, but could partner with the local delivery app, GiddyUP! Courier. </p>

<!-- Visual Samples --> 
			<h2> Visual Samples: </h2>
	<p> 
		Much of my inspiration came from Webby Award winners. </p>
		
		<ul>
  <li>  <a href="http://bymoby.com/webby/pagliacci_pizza/ ">This app</a> particularly impressed me by the level of personalization it offers. It allows users to save frequent orders for ease. The app also offers loyalty rewards, similar to what I’m planning on creating. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://frichti.sourceinteractive.fr/ "> This app</a> is able to pinpoint a users location and offer nearby food suggestions. While Xplore will not offer delivery service like the app linked, it still needs to be able to locate nearby restaurants for users. </li>
   <li> <a href="https://abhijitrawool.com/restaurant-website-color-palettes/">This website</a> showcases different palettes specifically for food related design. I have included a screenshot of the palette I am going to work with, along with it's description via the website.</li>
</ul>

		<p> I also included a few photos, taken from my peronsal work and from the internet, which serve as inspiration. These can be seen below. </p>
